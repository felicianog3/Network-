# OSI Model
A *model* simplifies the overall process by breaking it into discrete, simple, individual process.

* Application
* Presentation
* Session
* Transport
* Network
* Physical

*All people seem to need data processing. Please do not throw sausage pizza away.*

## Network & Hardware Layers

UTP (unshielded twisted pair) is a common cable in the neworking industry. Contains 4 pairs of wires that can transmit and receive data.

A "Central Box" handles the flow of data. Every machine is connected to the box via physical cable. The box connects ever computer to enable communication between them.

**Physical Layer** (Layer 1) is the method of moving data between computers. Copper cabling, fiber optics, and radia waves are part of the **Physical Layer**. Computer are connected to each other at this layer (not directly).

A *NIC* (Network interface card) is the interface between the PC and the network. Today they are no longer *cards*, as they are built into the actial motherboard.
